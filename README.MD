# Barrens Chat

## Description
Chose a size of a chat, give it a title and create. Create a chat in your workplace, 
in school, in a club, anywhere you want!. Anyone who will find himself in 
distance can join it and start talking with other people. 
After leaving distance you cannot write messages but you 
will receive notifications with messages from chat for 10 hours. Of course, if you want! If 
you want to talk with someone privately, invite him to friends. App is already published in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.believeapps.barrens)
